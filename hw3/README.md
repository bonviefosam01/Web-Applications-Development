1. Andrew ID: bfosam
2. Name: Bonvie Fosam
3. Homework: #3
4. Andrew IDs of students that I consulted on this homework: N/A
5. Andrew IDs of course staff that I consulted on this homework: I consulted one of the TA's, Bing, for this assignment.
6. Names of other people I consulted on this homework: N/A
7. List of external sources I consulted when solving this homework: Outside of course material, I used the django documentation material, w3schools, and chatGPT. I was confused about how the list of old guesses was supposed to be stored in the hidden input, and when I learned it should be stored as a string, I refered to this link to figure out how to implement joining the list: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/templates/language/. Next, I wanted to implement button disabling and used this link to figure out how: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_button_disabled.asp. I used chatGPT to supplement my understanding of the overal concepts of the assignment. Specifically, I queried for text based explanations of javascript webapp implementations vs django webapp implementations, use of hidden inputs vs use of request.sessions, and how specifically to pass data back and forth between html files and views.py.
8. Integrity Statement: I, Bonvie Fosam, did not electronically copy any source code, in whole or in part, from any source, other than the course examples provided to me this semester, when preparing my solution for this homework assignment.

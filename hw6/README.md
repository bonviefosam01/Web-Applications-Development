2. Name: Bonvie Fosam
3. Homework: #6
4. Andrew IDs of students that I consulted on this homework: N/A
5. Andrew IDs of course staff that I consulted on this homework: I consulted with Professor Terry Lee when i was having issues with passing AJAX comments data. He pointed me to specific lines of code I needed to consult to resolve the issue.
6. Names of other people I consulted on this homework: N/A
7. List of external sources I consulted when solving this homework: I used w3schools and documentation as a guide for document object modeling. I used chatGPT to provide further explanations of AJAX and XML Http requests. I specifically wanted a clearer explanation (dumbed down) of each component of the HTTP Requests. This helped me better understand how the data is transfered to the server. Here is a list of the specific links I used throughout the duration of this homework. (https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-prepend/, https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_node_textcontent.asp, https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_id.asp, https://www.w3schools.com/TAgs/att_href.asp, https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_classlist.as)
8. Integrity Statement: I, Bonvie Fosam, did not electronically copy any source code, in whole or in part, from any source, other than the course examples provided to me this semester, when preparing my solution for this homework assignment.

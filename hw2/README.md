1) Andrew ID: bfosam
2) Name: Bonvie Fosam
3) Homework: #2
4) Andrew IDs of students that I consulted on this homework: N/A
5) Andrew IDs of course staff that I consulted on this homework: N/A
6) Names of other people I consulted on this homework: N/A
7) List of external sources I consulted when solving this homework: Outside of course material, I used W3Schools as a reference for javascript syntax, how to reference css elements, and built in functions. The links I consulted are https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_includes.asp and https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_console_count.asp#gsc.tab=0 and https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_css.asp. I also used this link to find the color code for light gold: https://www.computerhope.com/cgi-bin/htmlcolor.pl?c=F1E5AC. I used this link to implement map in my js code: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_maps.asp. Finally, I used chatGPT to get a better idea of how wordle works on the back end because I was struggling to solve one of the use case errors I was getting on my autograder and wanted to understand if there was another to think about the task. I queried, "How does wordle work from a backend perspective" and in paragraph format it explained how a guess word is compared to a target word.
8) Integrity Statement: I, Bonvie Fosam, did not electronically copy any
source code, in whole or in part, from any source, other than the course
examples provided to me this semester, when preparing my solution for this
homework assignment.
